COMPUTATION:

In computing, computation refers to the process of performing mathematical calculations or processing data according to a set of rules or algorithms. Computation is driven by:
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU executes instuctions from programs and performs calculations.
2. Graphic Processing Unit (GPU): It is a specialized processor desinged to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation. It can handle many operations simultaneously.
3. Data Processing Unit (DPU): A DPU is a specialized processor desinged to hamdle and accelerate data-centric tasks.
4. Tensor Processing Unit (TPU):
