___COMPUTATION___

In computing, computation refers to the process of performing mathematical calculations or processing data according to a set of rules or algorithms. Computation is driven by:
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU executes instuctions from programs and performs calculations.
2. Graphic Processing Unit (GPU): It is a specialized processor desinged to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation. It can handle many operations simultaneously.
3. Data Processing Unit (DPU): A DPU is a specialized processor desinged to hamdle and accelerate data-centric tasks.
4. Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)

___MEMORY (RAM)___

Temporary storage used by the CPU to hold data and instructions while processing.
Function: Random Access Memory (RAM) is used for temporarily storing data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks.
Characteristics: Volatile, meaning it loses its data when the computer is turned off.

___NETWORK___

Network systems are essential for connecting computers and other devices to share resources, communicate, and access the internet. Here's an overview of network types, components, and a basic diagram to illustrate how they work together.

Types of Networks:

__1.Local Area Network (LAN):__
Description: A LAN connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or school. It allows for high-speed data transfer and resource sharing.
Components: Routers, switches, computers, printers, and other peripherals.
Example: A home network where multiple computers and devices are connected to the same router.

__2.Wide Area Network (WAN):__
Description: A WAN covers a large geographic area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents. It connects multiple LANs and other networks.
Components: Routers, switches, leased lines, and internet service providers (ISPs).
Example: The internet is the largest WAN, connecting millions of networks globally.

__3.Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):__
Description: A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city or a large campus.
Components: Routers, switches, and fiber optic cables.
Example: A network connecting several buildings or campuses within a city.

__4.Personal Area Network (PAN):__
Description: A PAN is a small network used for connecting devices within a very short range, usually a few meters.
Components: Bluetooth devices, USB connections.
Example: Connecting a smartphone to a laptop using Bluetooth.

___LAYER OF OSI___

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework used to understand and design network protocols by dividing the communication process into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific function and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each layer, from the physical hardware up to the application level:

__1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):__
Function: Handles the physical connection between devices, including the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium. This layer deals with hardware elements such as cables, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).
Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, USB, and network interface cards (NICs).

__2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):__
Function: Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the physical layer. It organizes data into frames and manages MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
Examples: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), and switches.

__3.Network Layer (Layer 3):__
Function: Responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. It manages logical addressing (IP addresses) and determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
Examples: Internet Protocol (IP), routers, and IP addressing.

__4.Transport Layer (Layer 4):__
Function: Manages end-to-end communication, error recovery, and flow control between devices. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and in the correct sequence.
Examples: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and port numbers.

__5.Session Layer (Layer 5):__
Function: Manages sessions or connections between applications. It handles session establishment, maintenance, and termination, ensuring that sessions are properly synchronized and data is correctly organized.
Examples: Session establishment protocols like NetBIOS and RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

__6.Presentation Layer (Layer 6):__
Function: Translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data encryption, decryption, compression, and conversion to ensure that data is in a readable format for the application layer.
Examples: Data encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS), data compression, and character encoding (e.g., ASCII, EBCDIC).

__7. Application Layer (Layer 7):__
Function: Provides network services directly to applications. It enables software applications to communicate over the network and offers various protocols and services for end-user applications.
Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System).

___OPERATING SYSTEM___
